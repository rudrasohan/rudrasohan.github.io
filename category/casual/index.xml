      <description>&lt;p&gt;Heavy breathing, beads of sweat dripping from my temple, hands gripping the moss-covered boulder as I pulled up myself, stepping carefully on the weakened bamboos creaking under my feet. As I stood atop the summit gripping tightly on the worn-out fence, my senses were overwhelmed by the scene underneath. The gleaming blue elixir coursing through the rocky creek surrounded by towering rock-giants and lush green pillars were ameliorating my fatigue. “Hey, we are here !!!”, shrieked Rathore, and I was back out of my immersion. The entire group was here, patting each other’s back for conquering Mawryngkhang. Sitting down, munching on some crackers we rambled and joked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
